# mqtt-testbed
This is a CS510 class project to demonstrate how to add some access controls to an MQTT broker.
If you're looking for a production-worthy or ready-to-use bit of technology, you stumbled into the
wrong place, this is just some students experimenting with privacy controls for a few weeks to
see what they can do.

It may still be of interest, of course, and while just the tip of the iceberg of what we'd like
to accomplish with our ideas, what we have here is still just some early ideas and proof-of-concept
demonstrations and experiments.

This repository is an experimental testbed where we have some forked code from open-source MQTT broker and client
systems we've experimented with, and our orchestration and analysis scripts, and reports we've written up about it all.
